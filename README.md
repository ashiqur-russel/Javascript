# THIS IS THE LEARNING PROJECT FROM "Codecademy.com"

## Rock, Paper, or Scissors

Rock paper scissors is a classic two player game. Each player chooses either rock, paper, or scissors. The items are compared, and whichever player chooses the more powerful item wins.

## Our code will break the game into four parts:

        1. Get the user’s choice.
        2. Get the computer’s choice.
        3. Compare the two choices and determine a winner.
        4. Start the program and display the results.
